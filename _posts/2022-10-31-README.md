## Prerequisites
We will need to install a few things to achieve our goal of hosting our Resume on a website using Github Pages.

- Markdown Editor
    - A mark-up language is very useful to learn and use. In Andrew Etter's Modern Technical Writing, he presses the importance of using a mark-up language to easily create XML that can then be shared with the world through Internet[^1]. I will be using Markdown out of all the possible mark-up languages because of it is the most widely used[^2]. 
    - Personally I like to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), you can use it to write Markdown and program your site as well. You can use any editor of your choice although. [Atom](https://atom.io/) is an editor specifically for Markdown. [Vim](https://vimhelp.org/) is an option for Markdown as well a code, not for the faint of heart.
    - I have provided a Markdown tutorial in [More Resources](#3-more-resources).

- GitHub Account
  - You will need to have a GitHub account. Your Github will allow you to store all your code in a repository (repo) online for free! Sign up [here](https://github.com/). This will also give us access to use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (more on this later).

- Git & Git Desktop
  - You will need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
  - Use [Git Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to connect the files on your computer to the repository. Connect your account and clone `[your-github-name].github.io` repository. This will allow you to push your data to the repo. [Reference here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) for more information on how to use Git Desktop. 
  - Andrew Etter prefers to use a GUI system such as this, it is better for basic everyday operations[^3]. More advanced functionality can be accessed through command line.

- Resume in Markdown
  - I have provided [my resume](/resume.md) for use in this repository. You can edit it using Visual Studio Code to your own resume by changing my information, education, and experience. ![resumegif](https://media0.giphy.com/media/72YyXcnj0DVZzVaF2d/giphy.gif)

- Ruby & Jekyll
  - We will also need to install these to run our website. I provided instructions to get them [here](#2-host-your-site).

## Instructions
### 1. GitHub Pages
GitHub Pages is great for its, "speed, simplicity, portability and security."[^4] We have no need to install anything to utilize this tool, so generating this site is as easy as moving a directory! We will be able to test this locally using the command line (more later), then using GitHub Desktop deploy it to our repository and our webpage will be generated. You will see why Andrew Etter has an irrational bias towards static websites.[^5] 

Repository Creation
- Navigate to [Github](https://github.com/) and create a repository. **Name this repo `[your-github-name].github.io`.** 
  ![Github Repository gif](https://media2.giphy.com/media/mgL99GKm27hZLZCbUC/giphy.gif?cid=790b7611df74b65c90b2a0f82e4dd3955b804307d3958091&rid=giphy.gif&ct=g)

Using Git Desktop, clone [your-github-name].github.io repository to your computer's drive.

### 2. Host Your Site
Hosting a static website allows you to easily keep your content up to date and on a website anybody can access. We will be using Jekyll because of its popularity[^6]. Andrew Etter states that static websites are "really just a collection of lightweight markup files that you can edit using your favorite text editor."[^7].

#### 1. Ruby Install
   - Go to [Ruby's Website](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and follow the guide on how to get it onto your system.
   - Run the command: `ruby -v` to ensure ruby has been installed.
#### 2. Jekyll Install
   - Then go to Jekyll's [Quickstart Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) and  [Installation Guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) and follow the guide on how to install it for your operation system.
   - Run the command: `jekyll -v` to ensure Jekyll has been installed.
#### 3. Initialize Site
   - To start your site, use the command line to navigate to your directory containing your repository. For example: `cd Documents/GitHub/[your-github-name].github.io`
   - Then run the command: `jekyll new [your-site-name]`
   - Navigate into that newly created folder with: `cd [your-site-name]`
     - You will likely need to add `webrick`, so run: `bundle add webrick` and `bundle install`
   - To run your newly created site: `bundle exec jekyll serve`  
   - The LocalHost will be provided to you in your terminal, open it in your web browser, and BOOM your website is now created!
#### 4. Customize
   - To add your resume to the site take your **resume.md** file and copy it to the `_posts` folder within the `[your-github-name].github.io` folder.
   - You will then have to append the file name with the date in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD-resume.md`
   - Then add to the top of your resume markdown file. This is so the Jekyll compiler can find and list your resume as a post.
```
---
layout: post
title:  "Resume"
date:   [current date + time]
categories: jekyll update
---
```

5. Finalize
   - Then using Git Desktop, push your data to your repository and go to the URL `https://[your-github-name].github.io` and your website with your resume listed as a post will be there! 

### 3. More Resources

1. This [Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) has helped me lots when learning Markdown.
2. Andrew Etter's *Modern Technical Writing* is a good read. You can find it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Technical-Writing-Introduction-Documentation-ebook/dp/B01A2QL9SS) on Amazon.
3. Learning Git is essential for us Computer Science students. Although Git Desktop is easy to use and quick to learn. Learning command line Git can greatly improve your Git proficiency. [This tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) goes very in-depth.
4. Using Jekyll you can apply themes to your website and make it look more appealing and customize it to your liking. Although it is not imperative to change the look, you can if you wish. Here are some resources to show you how to get these themes. [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), [JekyllThemes.org](http://jekyllthemes.org/). You can also search through GitHub and clone repositories with themes. You will be to apply what you have learned from this README & you also have the dependencies already from here to achieve this.

## FAQs

Q: Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

A: Markdown is much easier to parse into the languages our web browsers display to us, like HTML and XML. A word processor, like Microsoft Word and Google Docs, do not export well to these languages. As Andrew Etter says their purpose, "is to create short, attractive PDFs that can be consumed and discarded."[^8] Documentation needs to be kept in version control and updated over time without having to redistribute PDFs when something is changed or updated. Markdown gives us the flexibility to update our documentation without much effort. 

Q: Why is my resume not showing up?

A: There can be many reasons for this. Ensure that the name of your `resume.md` file has the prefix of a previous date and time. Dates in the future will not be displayed. Also ensure the file has the correct prefix at the top of the resume.md file:
```
layout: post
title:  "Resume"
date:   [current date + time]
categories: jekyll update
```
